## This is a small guide on how to make a loaf of bread.

You will need
- Free time (This is important)
- Some kind of over tray or bread tin ("900g loaf tin")
- Big plastic food bag
- 320-380ml of H2O (Water)
- 1 teaspoon of salt (This the can be less..or more if you are weird..)
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
- 6-7g of dried fast-action yeast (Will ensure it will rise)
- 500g of flour (this is personal preference)
- any additives you feel like you would enjoy, It's always nice to experiment, (If adding chocolate peices please be weary as it may not work that well)

Steps


1. Carefully put the salt, flour and yeast into a large bowl
2. Mix together (hands are prefered for this)
3. Slowly add between 320-380ml of lukewarm water and continue mixing until it turns into a soft dough
4. Have a lightly floured surface (this prevents sticking)
5. Carefully put the dough onto the surface
6. Knead the dough (until it is no longer sticky, add more flour if it takes too long)
7. Get the oven tray and apply olive oil too it
8. Fit in the dough carefully and equally
9.  Put it inside the plastic food bag and leave it to rise for 45m to an hour
10. After the hour, Poke it and if it doesn't spring back leave it for a bit longer
11. Preheat oven to around 200C (Please submit an issue if you know what recommened gas mark would be)
12. Cut across the top of the loaf 
13. Put it in the oven and beak for 30-45 minutes, best point is when it is a nice gold on the top
14. Carefully take it out and put it on a cooling rack and check the base of the bread to see if it cooked well (sounds hollow with a nice crack sound)
15. Leave it to cool

Congratulation you have made a loaf of bread, Now here is the fun part... Cutting it, I mean, Making really good toast.
